<p>Your blood is made up of liquid a
nd solids. The liquid part, called p
lasma, is made of water, salts, 
and protein. Over half of your b

lood is plasma. The solid part 
of your blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.<br><br>

Red blood cells (RBC) deliver oxygen from your lungs 
to your tissues and organs. White blood 
cells (WBC) fight infection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound. Bone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new blood
 cells. Blood cells constantly
  die and your body makes new ones
  . Red blood cells live about 120 days, 
  and platelets live 
  about 6 days. Some white
   blood cells live
    less than a day, but others live much longer.<br><br>

There are four blood type
s: A, B, AB, or O. Also, blood 
is either Rh-positive or Rh-
negative. So if you have type A
 blood, it's either A positive
  or A negative. Which type you
   are is important if you need 
   a blood transfusion. And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an 
   incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create
    problems.<br><br>

Blood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working. Problems with your blood may include bleeding disorders, excessive clotting and platelet disorders. If you lose too much blood, you may need a transfusion.
